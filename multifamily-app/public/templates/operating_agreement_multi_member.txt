The Members acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is intended to override any and all default rules and laws contained in the Act which conflict with this Agreement to the fullest extent an operating agreement is permitted to do so under the Act. The Members further acknowledge and agree that they wish to avoid a situation where a Member holding a minority Percentage Interest can veto or block the will of the Majority of Members.  Therefore, approval by a Majority of Members shall be sufficient for any acts or actions requiring Member approval under this Agreement or the Act unless: (i) this Agreement specifically requires a higher Member Percentage Interest approval; or (ii) both of the following apply: (A) the Act specifically requires a higher Member Percentage Interest approval, and (B) the law disallows that requirement from being overridden by this Agreement.  If a higher Membership Percentage Interest is required pursuant to subsection (ii) of the preceding sentence, then the conflicting provision of this Agreement shall be replaced by operation of law with the applicable requirement under the Act.

5.5	Manager’s Other Interests.  It is acknowledged that a Manager has or may have other business interests to which such Manager devotes part of such Manager’s time.

5.6	Compensation and Reimbursement.  Manager(s) shall not be entitled to compensation unless approved by the Majority of Members.  A Manager shall be entitled to reimbursement for all expenses reasonably incurred by a Manager in the performance of such Manager’s services; provided that such Manager provides the Company with appropriate documentation of the amount and purpose of such expenses.

5.7	Manager’s Authority.  Subject to Section 5.4 above and the Act, the Manager(s) will have the exclusive rights and complete power to manage the assets, liabilities, business, appointment rights, operations, and all other rights, powers, duties, and obligations of the Company, and to make all decisions for the Company and enter into all contracts, instruments and commitments on behalf of the Company, and do all other things for and on behalf of the Company which do not require the approval of the Members per Section 5.4 or the Act, including but not limited to (a) the management of all or any part of the Company’s business, operations, assets and/or liabilities, (b) the employment of persons, firms or entities for the operation and management of the Company’s business and/or assets, (c) to open bank accounts on behalf of the Company, and (d) the qualification to do business in states.  In the exercise of the management powers, a Manager is authorized to execute and deliver (i) all contracts, agreements, documents, instruments, certificates, conveyances, assignments, leases, subleases, quitclaims, grant deeds, warranty deeds, and other contracts and documents covering or affecting the Company’s assets or business; (ii) all checks, drafts and other orders for the payment of the Company’s funds; (iii) all promissory notes, loans, security agreements and other similar documents; and (iv) all other documents or instruments of any other kind relating to the Company’s affairs, business, operations or assets, whether like or unlike the foregoing. 

5.8	Management Decisions.  

5.8.1	One Manager.  So long as there is one (1) Manager, then that Manager is empowered with all the rights and obligations of a Manager and all Managers in this Agreement until such time as another Manager is added by a Majority of Members.

5.8.2	Two Managers.  If at a subsequent date, an additional Manager is added in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and there are then two (2) Managers, management decisions shall be approved by the unanimous decision of all Managers.  All power and authority of, or actions taken by, a Manager or Managers referenced in this Agreement or on behalf of the Company shall require the approval of both Managers.  If there is a disagreement between the Managers as to any action on behalf of the Company, the Managers shall seek a tie-breaking vote from the Majority of Members.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, one Manager has the authority to sign documents and sign contracts on behalf of the Company so long as the transaction and terms of the document or contract is approved by both Managers (and by the Majority of Members or higher Percentage Interest if required by this Agreement or the Act).  

5.8.3	More Than Two Managers.  If at a subsequent date, additional Managers are added in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, management decisions shall thereafter be approved by a majority decision of the Managers, with each Manager entitled to cast one vote for or against any matter submitted to the Managers for a decision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one Manager has the authority to sign documents and sign contracts on behalf of the Company so long as the transaction and terms of the document or contract is approved by both Managers (and by the Majority of Members or higher Percentage Interest if required by this Agreement or the Act).

5.9	Performance of Duties; Manager’s Liability.  A Manager shall not be liable to the Company or any Member for any loss or damage sustained by the Company or any Member, unless it shall have been the result of fraud, deceit, gross negligence, reckless or intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law by such Manager. A Manager shall perform its managerial duties in good faith, in a manner that Manager reasonably believes to be in the Company’s and Members’ best interests, and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. The Manager, in so performing its duties as Manager per the preceding sentence, shall not have any liability by reason of being or having been the Company’s Manager.

5.10	Reliance by Third Parties.  Third parties dealing with the Company shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon the power and authority of a Manager or the Managers to manage and operate the business and affairs of the Company.

5.11	Reliance on Third Parties.  In performing management duties, a Manager shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, and opinions, reports and statements as to the amount or value of Company assets, liabilities, profits, and losses, and the value of any property that may be acquired by the Company or that may secure a loan made by the Company, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which distributions to Members might properly be paid, if such information, opinion, report or statement is given by any of the following Persons or groups, unless a Manager in performing such duty has actual knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted, and provided that such Manager acts in good faith and after reasonable inquiry when the need therefor is indicated by the circumstances:  (a) one or more officers, employees or other agents of a Manager or the Company whom such Manager reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; or (b) any attorney, accountant, appraiser, engineer, architect, or other person as to matters which such Manager reasonably believes to be within such person’s professional or expert competence.
 

5.12	Meetings of Managers.  If there is more than one Manager, regular meetings of the Managers are not required but may be held at such time and place as the Managers deem necessary or desirable for the reasonable management of the Company.

5.13	Meetings of Members.  If there is more than one Member, annual, regular, or special meetings of the Members are not required but may be held at such time and place as the Members deem necessary or desirable. A written notice setting forth the date, time, and location of a meeting must be sent at least ten (10) days but no more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each Member entitled to vote at the meeting. A Member may waive notice of a meeting by sending a signed waiver to the Company’s principal executive office or as otherwise provided in the Act. In any instance in which the approval of the Members is required under this Agreement, such approval may be obtained in any manner permitted by the Act, including by conference call or similar communications equipment. Any action that could be taken at a meeting may be approved by a consent in writing that describes the action to be taken and is signed by Members holding the minimum Percentage Interest required to approve the action. If any action is taken without a meeting and without unanimous written consent of the Members, notice of such action must be sent to each Member that did not consent to the action. A consent transmitted by electronic transmission will be deemed to be written and signed for purposes of this Section.

5.14	Majority of Members.  Whenever in this Agreement reference is made to the decision, consent, approval, judgment, or action of the Members, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or required by the Act, such decision, consent, approval, judgment, or action shall mean a Majority of Members.

5.15	Competing Activities.  A Manager and its officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, managers, agents, employees and affiliates may engage or invest in, independently or with others, any business activity of any type or description, including those that might be the same as or similar to the Company’s business and that might be in direct or indirect competition with it. Neither the Company nor any Member shall have any right in or to such other ventures or activities or to the income or proceeds derived therefrom. A Manager shall not be obligated to present any investment opportunity or prospective economic advantage to the Company, even if the opportunity is such that, if presented to the Company, could be taken by it. A Manager shall have the right to hold any investment opportunity or prospective economic advantage for its own account or to recommend such opportunity to Persons other than the Company. The Members acknowledge that a Manager and its affiliates own and/or manage (or may own and/or manage) other businesses, including businesses that may compete with the Company and for a Manager’s time. The Members waive all rights and claims which they may otherwise have against a Manager and its officers, directors, shareholders, partners, members, managers, agents, employees and affiliates as a result of any of such activities.

5.16	Transactions Between Company and Manager.  Notwithstanding any possible conflict of interest, a Manager may, and may cause its affiliates to, engage in any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service, or the establishment of any salary, compensation or other terms of employment) with the Company so long as such transaction is not expressly prohibited by this Agreement and so long as such transaction, on an overall basis, is fair and reasonable to the Company and at least as favorable to the Company as those generally available from Persons capable of similarly performing them and in similar transactions between parties operating at arm’s length, and provided that a Majority of Members having no interest in such transaction (other than their interests as Members) affirmatively vote or consent in writing to approve the transaction. A transaction between the Manager and/or its affiliates on the one hand, and the Company on the other hand, shall be conclusively determined to constitute a transaction on terms and conditions, on an overall basis, fair and reasonable to the Company and at least as favorable to the Company as those generally available in a similar transaction between parties operating at arm’s length if a Majority of Members having no interest in such transaction (other than their interests as Members) affirmatively vote or consent in writing to approve the transaction.

The Company may establish reasonable Percentage Interest ownership record dates, which shall not be greater than fourteen (14) days prior to an applicable Company distribution, allocation, vote, or other purpose, for purposes of determining the persons entitled to such distribution, allocation, vote, or other matter.

7.5	Member Tax Information.

ARTICLE 8
TRANSFER OF MEMBERSHIP INTEREST

8.1 	Sale or Encumbrance Prohibited. Except for Transfers to Permitted Transferees, no Member may voluntarily or involuntarily transfer, sell, convey, encumber, pledge, assign, or otherwise dispose of (jointly and severally referred to as “Transfer”) an interest in the Company without the prior written consent of a Majority of Members, if applicable. The provisions of this Section 8.1 and Sections 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 shall not apply to a Transfer to a Permitted Transferee.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6 shall not apply when this Company is a single-member limited liability company. 

8.2 	Right of First Refusal. If such consent is received pursuant to Section 8.1, a Member may transfer all or any part of the Member’s membership interest in the Company (the “Interest”) as follows:

	8.2.1 	The Member desiring to transfer its Interest first must provide written notice (the “Notice”) to the other Member(s) of such Member’s intent to Transfer its Interest.  The purchase price of the Interest will be the “Fair Option Price” of the Interest as determined and agreed to by all Members.   If the Members are unable to so agree within 30 days of the Notice date, the Members shall agree on an appraiser to determine the Fair Option Price of the Interest.  If the Members cannot agree on an appraiser within 45 days of the Notice date, then the transferring Member will appoint, within 60 days of the Notice date, one appraiser, and the Company shall appoint within 60 days of the Notice, one appraiser.  The two appraisers will within a period of 30 additional days, agree on and appoint an additional appraiser.  The one (1) appraiser or three (3) appraisers (as applicable) will, within 60 days after all applicable appraisers are hired, determine the Fair Option Price of the Interest in writing and submit their reports to all Members (“Fair Option Price Notification”).  The Fair Option Price will be determined by disregarding the appraiser’s valuation that diverges the most from each of the other two appraisers’ valuations, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining two appraisers’ valuations will be the Fair Option Price.  If only one (1) appraiser is used, the transferring Member and Company shall share equally in the fee charged by the appraiser.  If three (3) appraisers are used, then the transferring Member will pay for the services of the appraiser selected by it, and the Company will pay for the services of the appraiser selected by it, and the transferring Member and Company shall share equally in the fee charged by the third appraiser and of all other costs relating to the determination of Fair Option Price. 

	8.2.2 	The Member(s) may acquire all, but not less than all, of the Interest at the Fair Option Price. If the other Member(s) desiring to acquire the Interest cannot agree among themselves on the allocation of the Interest among them, the allocation will be proportional to the Percentage Interest in the Company of those Members desiring to acquire the Interest.  The Member(s) who have decided to purchase the Interest for the Fair Option Price shall notify the transferring Member within 30 days from the date of the Fair Option Price Notification of the Member(s) intent to purchase the Interest.   

	8.2.3 	The closing of the Transfer of the Interest to other Member(s) will occur not less than 45 days after the Fair Option Price Notification unless the Member(s) participating in the Transfer unanimously agree to a shorter period of time.

	8.2.4 	If all of the other Member(s) fail or refuse to notify the transferring Member of their desire to acquire all of the Interest proposed to be transferred within the 30-day period following receipt of the Fair Option Price Notification, then the Member(s) will be deemed to have waived the right to acquire the Interest, and the transferring Member may sell and convey the Interest for the Fair Option Price to any other person or entity; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in Section 8.2 to the contrary, should the potential sale to a third person be at a price or on terms that are more favorable to the purchaser than the Fair Option Price, then the transferring Member must reoffer the sale of the Interest to the remaining Member(s) at such other price and/or other terms, and the Member(s) have thirty (30) days to accept the revised terms in the re-offer.

8.3 	Substituted Members. If a Transfer was authorized and completed to a third party pursuant to this Agreement, but the new transferee is not a Permitted Transferee and the transferee has not become a fully substituted Member in accordance with Section 8.3, then such transferee will have only rights to receive distributions whenever made by the Company and the allocable share of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit (“Economic Rights”) with respect to the Interest transferred. Any Transfer of Economic Rights will not include any right to participate in management of the Company, including any right to vote, or consent to any action, and except to the extent required by the Act will not include any right to Company information or access to Company books and records  unless and until the transferee is admitted as a substitute Member; provided, that a holder of Economic Rights shall be entitled to receive annually form K-1 for federal income tax purposes and a comparable state income tax form reporting the transferee’s allocated income and other information as required to be reported on form K-1 under the IRC or Regulations. Following any Transfer of only the Economic Rights of a Member’s Interest in the Company, the transferring Member’s power and right to vote or consent to any matter submitted to the Members will be eliminated, and the Percentage Interest of the remaining Members, for purposes only of such votes, consents, and participation in management, will be proportionately increased until such time, if any, as the transferee of the Economic Rights becomes a substituted Member. A transferee of a Member’s Interest shall not become a substituted Member unless and until:

	(a)	A Majority of Members, determined without taking into account the Percentage Interest of the Member making the Transfer, consent in writing to the Transfer; provided, however, that in the case of a Transfer to a Permitted Transferee, such approval by the Members shall not be required for the transferee to become a substituted Member;

	(b)	The transferor and transferee (including a Permitted Transferee) execute and deliver to the Company the documents and instruments of conveyance necessary or appropriate in the opinion of counsel to the Company to effect the Transfer and to confirm the agreement of the transferee to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement; 

	(c)	Unless waived in writing by the Manager(s) or a Majority of Members, the transferor furnishes to the Company an opinion of counsel, satisfactory to the Company, that the Transfer does not require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as then in effect, or registration or qualification, or any similar action (including but not limited to obtaining the consent or approval of the state commissioner or any similar officer of any other state) under any state securities or blue sky law, due to exemptions to such registration or qualification requirements; and

	(d)	Unless waived in writing by the Manager(s) or a Majority of Members, the transferor furnishes to the Company an opinion of counsel, satisfactory to the Company, that the Transfer will not cause the Company to terminate for federal income tax purposes and will not cause the Company’s tax election to be modified for federal income tax purposes.

8.4 	Bankruptcy of Member. On the bankruptcy of a Member, the successor in interest to the Member (whether an estate, bankruptcy trustee, or otherwise) will receive only Economic Rights with respect to the Interest of the bankrupt Member unless and until a Majority of Members, determined without taking into account the Percentage Interest of the bankrupt Member, determine to admit the transferee as a substituted Member in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3.
	
8.5 	Death or Dissolution of a Member. If during the Company’s term a Member dies or is adjudicated incompetent or an entity Member is dissolved or a Member that is a trust is terminated, the Member’s legal representative or successor shall have the rights of an assignee of the Member’s Economic Rights, but not the other rights of a Member, unless and until the legal representative or successor(s) is a Permitted Transferee or has been admitted as a Member under Section 8.3.

8.6 	Withdrawal by a Member.  A Member has no right or power to withdraw from the Company, to withdraw its Capital Contribution or to demand and receive property of the Company or any distributions on its Capital Account, except distributions approved by the Managers or required by this Agreement or the Act or as permitted by the Managers and with the unanimous consent of the Members.

8.7	Charging Order Protection.  The following shall apply to the maximum extent allowed by the Act or other applicable law: (i) any Member whose membership interest is subject to a charging order shall remain a Member and retain all rights and powers of a Member except the right to receive distributions to the extent charged; and (ii) the judgment creditor’s rights shall be limited to Economic Rights of such Member and nothing more during the duration of the charging order.  

ARTICLE 9
DISSOLUTION AND WINDING UP OF THE COMPANY

9.1 	Dissolution. The Company will be dissolved on the happening of any of the following events:
9.1.1 	Sale, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company;

	9.1.2 	The agreement of a Majority of Members (unless a higher percentage is required by the Act); or

	9.1.3 	By operation of law.

9.2 	Winding Up. On the dissolution of the Company, the Members must take full account of the Company’s assets and liabilities, and the assets will be liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining their fair value, and the proceeds, to the extent sufficient to pay the Company’s obligations with respect to the liquidation, will be applied and distributed, after any gain or loss realized in connection with the liquidation has been allocated in accordance with Article 3 of this Agreement, and the Members’ Capital Accounts have been adjusted to reflect the allocation and all other transactions through the date of the distribution, in the following order:

	9.2.1 	To payment and discharge of the expenses of liquidation and of all the Company’s debts and liabilities to Persons or organizations other than Members;

	9.2.2 	To the payment and discharge of any Company debts and liabilities owed to Members; and

	9.2.3 	To Members in the amount of their respective adjusted Capital Account balances on the date of distribution.

9.3	Members Look Solely to Company Assets.  Each Member and each holder of Economic Rights shall look solely to the Company for all distributions with respect to the Company and their Capital Account, and no Member or Economic Rights holder shall have any recourse in connection with any distribution (upon dissolution or otherwise) against the Managers, any liquidating trustee, or any other Member or holder of Economic Rights.

ARTICLE 10
POWER OF ATTORNEY

Each Member irrevocably appoints each Manager as the Member’s attorney-in-fact, with power and authority to act in the name and on behalf of each such Member to execute, acknowledge, and swear to in the execution, acknowledgment and filing of documents which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, and record in the appropriate public offices the following:

10.1.2	All consents to transfers of Interests, to the admission of substitute or additional Members, all amendments of this Agreement, to the extent that such actions are authorized by the terms of this Agreement; and
